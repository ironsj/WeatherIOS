# WeatherIOS

This is a weather app I made to practice pulling data from an API. This app has a very simple UI as it was not the main focus of this project. If you wish to run this yourself you will need to create a free API from OpenWeatherMap and put this key in a file called `Keys.plist`. In the `ViewController`, set `keyName` equal to whatever you named your key in `Keys.plist`.
